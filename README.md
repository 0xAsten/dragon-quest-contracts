Dragon-quest is a text-based game.

You should mint an adventurer and start your adventure. Immediately you will encounter a red dragon, even though you have little chance of defeating him but you insist on challenging him to prove you are a true warrior.

The adventurer is a fork of [Realms's adventurer](https://github.com/BibliothecaForAdventurers/realms-contracts/blob/main/contracts/loot/adventurer/Adventurer.cairo) contract

The game is only running on Goerli Alpha Testnet now.

The dragon seems difficult for adventurers to defeat. So I am planning design some easier secens to give adventurers a chance to exercise.

Maybe they can get weapons to increase damage, get equipments to advance armor class, get experience to improve battle skills.
